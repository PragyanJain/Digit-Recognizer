# Digit-Recognizer

We developa   means   to classify   a   given   image   of   a handwritten number into one of ten classes.  These ten classes beingsingle digit integers 0 to 9. Using Machine Learning (ML) concepts  we  can  approach  this  situation  in  various  ways.  By using:   Neural   Networks(NN),   Support   Vector   Machines (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). To begin, we look at the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 handwritten images of theintegers from 0 to 9. MNIST stands for modified, natural institute of standards and technology dataset.
